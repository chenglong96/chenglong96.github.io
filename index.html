  <h1>New Player Retention in Torn</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> New player retention and engagement are crucial elements for any online video game. Without a stable number of newly registered accounts, multiplayer games centered around community and player interaction are bound to become abandoned and fail. In this study, I aim to evaluate the new player retention rate of an online role-playing game called Torn.</p>

    <p><strong>Study design:</strong> Using publicly available information, I have analysed 367,078 player accounts created between July 1 2023 and July 1 2024.</p>

    <p><strong>Results:</strong> The first few days of gameplay are crucial for player retention. Over the first couple of months, player retention rate steadily decreases, eventually settling down around 18–20% after the first year. Level seems to be another important factor when it comes to players staying in the game — majority of players quitting do so before reaching level 15, an important milestone in the Torn gameplay loop.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> My findings highlight potential shortfalls of the game design and provide some basic guidelines when considering potential recruits for new members when forming in-game groups (factions).</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Video games are a common pastime activity in today's society. According to survey data, single-player games are overwhelmingly more popular than multiplayer games [1]. This is not entirely unexpected, as multiplayer games are usually more complex and require a larger time investment due to their inherent competitive nature...</p>

  <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
  <h3>Study population</h3>
  <p>For this analysis, all accounts between IDs 2975573 and 3342765 were analysed using Torn's official API...</p>

  <h3>Data collection and analysis</h3>
  <p>All data was collected between September 19th and September 21th, 2024, using a Google Appscript time driven scripts for recording. Custom python scripts were used for data gathering, analysis and visualisation [4].</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>

  <h3>Most new accounts are fake</h3>
  <p>Original study data included 367,078 accounts. However, after closer inspection, it became evident that at least half of these accounts (50.34%, 184,792) are either created by bots or some other artificial means...</p>

  <h3>Player retention rate drops off early, but stabilises later on</h3>
  <p>Looking at the accounts with over 1 hour of play time, we can see that initially player retention rate appears rather high...</p>

  <h3>Most players quit early</h3>
  <p>While the data above looks at players who have already played almost a full month of the game, a different picture comes up when investigating the age at which player accounts become inactive...</p>
